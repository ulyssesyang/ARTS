# Binary Tree

Binary Tree is a very unique hierarchical tree structure which only has at most two child node.

## Traverse Tree

There are three different ways to traverse BTree:

- Pre-order Traversal
- In-order Traversal
- Post-order Traversal

For these three ways, all can be done recursively or iteratively.
